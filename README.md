# [Project 1: Focusing on cleaning and visulisation using R](https://github.com/robertmash/intro_to_data_science)
- Used packages: Tidyvserse, ggplot2, janitor, here, and lubridate.
- Uses data from Nasa and GOV.uk, I've linked these below. 
- Visualise trends and statistics based of climate change, and rates of stops and searches throughout my investigation.
- I find that In 2017, that black people were up to 8 times more likely to be stopped in comparison to white people. This is similar with the Asian population who are increasingly more likely to be stopped over white individuals. I didn't include the "Other" variable as it was missing some data, which wouldnt add any impact to the conclusion.

# [Project 2: Statistical Methods and Data Analysis](https://github.com/robertmash/Statistical_Analysis_Project/blob/main/cw_stats.Rmd)
- Firstly cleaning the datasets and collecting summary stats about each variable. 
- We look at 3 main datasets, car data, comicbook characters and premier league players.
- Also look at 'Salaries' dataset within R, which illistrates the 
- Implementing statistical analysis on a multitude of datasets to derive statistically significant results
- Using linear, multi-linear and logistic regression methods. 
- Plotting confidence intervals & checking for normality. 
- Plotting ROC, interpretting the AUC. Graphing my findings, showing both sensitivity and specificity values. 
- Creating a GLM for the 'divisionWinners' of our baseball dataset. This is then split into a test and training set, to graph the ROC and a confusion matrix comparing the full and reduced model.

# Project 3: Student Database Project

## [Section 1:](https://github.com/robertmash/StudentDatabase_Project/blob/main/programming%20for%20ds/CW1/CW1.ipynb)
- Project is split into two sections. 
- First section focusing is on data-preprocessing, creating functions to clean and ready the data to be worked on. This involves:
- Standardising, normalising, removing duplicates and creating an SQL database for these results. 

## [Section 2:](https://github.com/robertmash/StudentDatabase_Project/tree/main/programming%20for%20ds/cw2)
- Second part of the project involves using the SQL database to create export the database and creating subsets for the students.
- This involves identifying which students are hardworking i.e. scored > 60 in all tests
- Highlighting underperfoming students i.e. scored < 60 in all tests.
- Addittionally, I create a GUI section of the programme so when the user inputs a student ID, the specific results are given back to the user.

# [Project 4: Data Mining Project](https://github.com/robertmash/DataMining_Project)
- Using Weka to produce a report focusing on the implementation of machine learning methods
- I firstly pre-process the dataset. 
- Initalise linear regression and relevant attribute evalutors (OneRule, Relief F)
- Implementation of supervised learning classifiers (Lazy IBk classifer, Naive Bayes)
- Implementation of equal binning, tweaking this parameter for optimised results.
- Finally, using K-means clustering onto the dataset.

# [Project 5: Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/robertmash/MachineLearning_Project/blob/main/cw%20files%20.ipynb)
- Explored supervised machine learning methods, tweaking parameters and using stacking to increase predictability.
- I will be applying support machine vectors (SMV), decision trees and k-nearest neighbour algorithms to train a dataset to precisely identify the main contributors towards maternal mortality risk within Bangladesh. After modelling I will be using feature selection, to reduce the number of attributes contributing towards the model, helping to improve the performance of the model. Our results found that stacking of both SVM and decision trees gave the most accurate results

- The dataset is in a structured format with 1014 instances, comprising of 7 attributes that are a mixture of integers, floats, and objects. Fortunately, there are no missing entries across the entire dataset. The properties contain the age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar levels, body temperature, heart rate and the associated level of maternal risk, ranked low, mid, and high. The attributes give us an overall understanding of the health of the individual. Specifically, heart health.

# [Project 6: Data Visualisations (tableau)](https://github.com/robertmash/Tableau_visualisations/blob/main/README.md)

In this study, I will be utilising 7 main variables to evaluate and achieve my objectives. The maternal mortality rate details the rate of deaths per 100,000 of live births that take place within a country. This will be our main metric of our evaluation, comparing the rate of fatalities between countries will enable me to accurately underpin the quality of medical technologies that are within specific country/region. Additionally, I will be utilising evaluative statistics that are specific to the individual. These include whether the birth was completed by a caesarean, whether the pregnant women had sufficient iron levels throughout the pregnancy and if the women has been subject to female genital mutilation.
