# [Project 1: Focusing on cleaning and visulisation using R](https://github.com/robertmash/intro_to_data_science)
- used packages: Tidyvserse, ggplot2, janitor, here, and lubridate.
- Uses data from Nasa and GOV.uk, I've linked these below. 
- Visualise trends and statistics based of climate change, and rates of stops and searches throughout my investigation.
- I find that In 2017, we can denote that black people were up to 8 times more likely to be stopped in comparison to white people. This is similar with the Asian population who are increasingly more likely to be stopped over white individuals. I didn't include the "Other" variable as it was missing some data, which wouldnt add any impact to the conclusion.

# [Project 2: Statistical Methods and Data Analysis](https://github.com/robertmash/stats_project)
- Implementing statistical analysis on a multitude of datasets to derive statistically significant results
- Using linear, multi-linear and logistic regression methods. 
- Plotting confidence intervals & checking for normality. 
- Plotting ROC, interpretting the AUC. Graphing my findings, showing both sensitivity and specificity values. 


## Statistical visualisations (ROC, log10 relationships, Residual vs Leverage and Specificity & Sensitivity):
